Taktik \- Detailed Game Manual (English Translation)

1\. Game Objective

• Tactical board game based on a rectangular 20×30 grid (each cell \= 5 km).

• Players: 2 (attacker and defender).

• The game can end in various ways. Victory conditions are agreed upon before the match, individually or combined:

1\. Total annihilation — eliminate all enemy units.

2\. Capture and hold — occupy a base or flag and hold it for X turns.

3\. Victory Points (VP) — accumulate VP through eliminations, zone control, or card usage; the first to reach the agreed threshold wins.

4\. Timed resistance — survive until turn X; if the defender holds, they win.

5\. Logistics run — transport supplies from point A to point B a set number of times.

6\. Secret missions — hidden objectives assigned at the start; whoever completes theirs wins.

7\. Territorial control — after X turns, the player controlling the most strategic points wins.

8\. Target elimination (assassination) — destroy a specific unit or leader.

9\. Evacuation/Exfiltration — move N units off the map via evacuation points.

10\. Resource accumulation — control resources until reaching an agreed threshold.

11\. Sabotage enemy lines — neutralize structures or logistics (e.g., depots).

12\. Combined scoring — sum of VP, objectives, and control after a set time; highest total wins.

2\. Board and Units

• Board layout: 20 alphabetic columns and 30 numeric rows.

• Unit types: light infantry, mechanized infantry, special units.

• Total units per player: 15 for the Defender and 10 for the Attacker.

• Light infantry: 6–8

• Mechanized infantry: 3–5

• Special units: 1–2

• Movement per turn: maximum of 5 units may move.

• Movement logic: all directions (8 quadrants), intrinsic movement value:

  – Infantry: 1–2

  – Vehicles: 3–4

  – Special units: 2–3

• Topographical terrain includes rivers, roads, hills, and urban areas, affecting or enabling certain movements.

Movement Dynamics

• Restricting movable units forces management of rear lines and cover.

• Gradual advancement prevents isolated units.

Tactical Realism

• The attacker begins with fewer units but with initiative.

• The defender starts with more units already deployed.

• Movement and card rules simulate real operational constraints and unpredictability.

3\. Dice

• Standard 6-sided die.

• Determines action effectiveness: ranged fire, required hits to eliminate units, etc.

• Distance in hexes determines die roll needed to hit.

4\. Cards

4.1 Types

Two separate decks:

1 — Common Deck (60/90 cards)

• 36/56 bonus cards (10/20 special, 26/36 generic)

  These may be kept face-down as tactical cards (max 6).

  They can cancel malus effects or grant tactical advantages (movement, attack, supplies).

• 24/34 malus cards (6/9 special, 18/25 generic)

  Must be declared and played immediately.

  Special cards grant unique and rare effects (air support, blackout, sabotage).

2 — Initial Tactical Deck (bonus only):

  Players choose 6 secret cards at the start, defining their command style.

4.2 Bonus Cards

• Dual function: cancel malus or grant advantages (movement, attack, extra units).

• Neutral cards: usable only against specific malus (e.g., “Internal Discipline”).

• Special cards: powerful, rare effects.

4.3 Malus Cards

• Represent realistic difficulties: logistics, morale, politics, cyber, information.

• Special examples: UN ceasefire, sanctions, logistical blockades.

• “Enemy Disinformation”: opponent chooses a unit you cannot move.

4.4 Card Handling

• Malus: played immediately unless canceled by a bonus card.

• Bonus: may be played or stored (max 6 face-down).

• Shuffle deck at end.

5\. Initial Deployment

• Front line traced at 1/3 of the map:

  – Defender occupies the rear 2/3.

  – Attacker occupies the remaining 1/3 and deploys afterward.

6\. Movement and Combat Mechanics

• Units move based on intrinsic characteristics:

  – Infantry: 1 cell

  – Mechanized Infantry: 3 cells

  – Heavy Artillery: 2 cells

• Dice determine action effectiveness.

Tactical Realism

• Limiting movable units creates tactical choices and rear-line management.

• Constraints simulate realistic tactical operations.

8\. Card-Unit Interaction

• Bonus effects: increased movement, improved attack, or malus cancellation.

  Examples: Artillery Support, Extra Supplies, Troop Motivation, International Aid,

  Electronic Countermeasures, Internal Discipline.

• Neutral cards: become defensive tools when held.

• Malus effects: force hard tactical choices.

  Examples: Enemy Disinformation, Ammo Shortage, Mechanical Failure,

  International Pressure (ceasefire), Disrupted Supply Lines.

9\. Specific Missions

• Village Defense — defender must hold key units.

• Coordinated Assault — attacker captures a key quadrant with minimal losses.

• Convoy Protection — defender must move a unit across the map.

• Rapid Reconquest — attacker retakes lost quadrants.

• Neutralize Special Unit — eliminate or immobilize enemy special units.

• Advanced Tactical Support — use at least 2 bonus cards to gain advantage.
