visual style: Brutalist Constructivism,
cold war military operational aesthetic,
constructivist composition with brutalist surfaces,
flat colors only,
no gradients,
no soft lighting,
high contrast,
authoritative and cold,
designed like a military operations room,
diagrammatic, not illustrative,
clean edges,
hard shapes,
no decoration,
constructivist propaganda poster layout
