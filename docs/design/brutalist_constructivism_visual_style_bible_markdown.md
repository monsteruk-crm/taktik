# Brutalist Constructivism – Visual Style Bible

A **strict visual system** for a tactical board game.

> **Constructivism defines structure and hierarchy.**  
> **Brutalism defines materiality and presence.**

This document is **normative**, not inspirational.

## Core Principle (Non‑Negotiable)

- **Constructivism** governs:
  - Layout
  - Hierarchy
  - Directionality
  - Motion logic

- **Brutalism** governs:
  - Surfaces
  - Containers
  - UI objects
  - Physical presence

These roles **must never be mixed**.

If a layout feels chunky → it is wrong.  
If a button feels expressive → it is wrong.

## Color System

### Base Palette (default UI)
- **Concrete White** `#E6E6E2`
- **Charcoal Black** `#1B1B1B`
- **Industrial Gray** `#8A8F94`

### Accent / Command Colors
- **Signal Red** `#C1121F` — attack, danger, malus
- **Command Yellow** `#F2B705` — alerts, turn state
- **Operational Blue** `#1F4E79` — control, defense, intel
- **Field Green** `#4A6F3C` — logistics, terrain

**Rules:**
- Maximum **2 accent colors per screen**
- No gradients
- No color softening
- Contrast must be deliberate and aggressive

---

## Typography

### Primary Typeface (UI / Data)
- DIN
- Inter
- IBM Plex Sans

**Preferences:**
- Condensed when possible
- Uppercase dominant
- Numeric clarity prioritized

### Secondary Typeface (Headings / Cards)
- Heavy grotesk **or** slab

**Forbidden:**
- Italics
- Decorative fonts
- Script or handwriting

Maximum **2 fonts total**.

---

## Layout Rules (Constructivist Discipline)

- Everything aligned to a grid
- Strong diagonals for emphasis
- Asymmetry encouraged
- White space used as hierarchy

Nothing is centered “for aesthetics”.

---

## UI Components (Brutalist Execution)

### Panels
- Rectangular slabs only
- Thick borders
- Flat color fills
- No decorative detail

### Buttons
- Rectangles only
- No rounded corners
- Text‑first
- Interaction via color inversion

---

## Units & Map

### Units
- Silhouette‑first design
- Readable at small size
- Unit class identifiable by **shape**, not color

### Map
- Symbolic, not realistic
- Diagrammatic representation
- Terrain as abstraction

The map must read like an operational chart, not a landscape.

---

## Cards

Cards behave like **constructivist propaganda posters**:

- Bold typography
- Icon + text
- Large negative space
- Single dominant idea

No illustrative scenes. No storytelling imagery.

---

## Motion & Animation

Motion is **functional only**:
- Cut
- Slide
- Snap

**Forbidden:**
- Ease‑in / ease‑out
- Bounce
- Elasticity
- Personality

---

## Forbidden Elements (Kill on Sight)

If any appear, reject the asset immediately:

- Gradients
- Soft shadows
- Friendly or playful UI
- Painterly textures
- Pixel art
- Decorative noise
- Cinematic effects

---

## Canon Statement

> **A cold, authoritative tactical system that looks like it was designed by an operations command, not a game studio.**
