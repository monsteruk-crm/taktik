01 — PLAIN
TERRAIN: PLAIN
Top face is mostly empty.
Only minimal command-board markings allowed:
- 2–4 thin rectangular insets OR small corner notches OR sparse micro-blocks
  Keep it the quietest tile in the set.

02 — ROUGH
TERRAIN: ROUGH
Top face shows disrupted traversal using abstract broken geometry:
- irregular rectangular fragments
- offset blocks
- gaps and misalignments
  No rubble illustration, only broken pattern logic.

03 — FOREST
TERRAIN: FOREST
Top face uses dense vertical block repetition:
- many tall thin rectangles
- staggered rows
- high density zones + small clear lanes
  No organic shapes. No trees. Forest is implied purely by vertical density.

04 — URBAN
TERRAIN: URBAN
Top face uses rigid orthogonal structure:
- rectilinear grid blocks
- varied block sizes like building footprints
- clear straight corridors like streets
  Feels like a stamped planning diagram, not a city illustration.

05 — HILL
TERRAIN: HILL
Top face uses stepped elevation bands:
- 3–5 nested diamond or angular contour plates
- clean hard-edged terraces
  No gradients. No slope shading. Elevation is implied by discrete steps only.

06 — WATER
TERRAIN: WATER
Top face uses controlled banding:
- horizontal or slightly angled parallel bands
- calm spacing and repetition
  No wave art. No reflections. No organic curves.
  Water is a procedural surface, not a liquid illustration.

07 — ROAD
TERRAIN: ROAD
Top face has one strong linear corridor:
- a thick straight band crossing the tile edge-to-edge
- optional secondary thin lane marking as a parallel band
  Maintain strict geometry and alignment.
  No dashed paint, no realism.

08 — BRIDGE
TERRAIN: BRIDGE
Top face shows a narrow traversal spine:
- a central thick bar spanning edge-to-edge
- hard symmetric supports as small rectangles near ends
  Bridge must read as constrained passage, not architecture.

09 — TRENCH
TERRAIN: TRENCH
Top face uses angular zig-zag cut pattern:
- one continuous broken line path with sharp turns
- optional parallel reinforcement line
  No dirt texture. No depth. Trench is an abstract defensive channel.

10 — INDUSTRIAL
TERRAIN: INDUSTRIAL
Top face uses heavy asymmetric machinery footprint logic:
- chunky rectangles, offsets, dense clusters
- a few small “service channel” lines
  Feels like an equipment pad diagram. No machines illustrated.

11 — RUBBLE (optional second wave)
TERRAIN: RUBBLE
Top face is fragmented but with smaller debris logic than ROUGH:
- many small rectangles and shards
- clustered uneven density
  Still abstract: no rocks, no bricks, no texture.

12 — SWAMP (optional second wave)
TERRAIN: SWAMP
Top face uses irregular “soft ground” zones via abstract blobs BUT still geometric:
- rounded-rectangle islands (NOT organic curves)
- negative space pools
  No water illustration. No reeds. Just ambiguous mobility zones.

13 — FORTIFICATION (later)
TERRAIN: FORTIFICATION
Top face uses defensive geometry:
- thick perimeter segment (one or two sides)
- angular bastion-like blocks (rectangles + trapezoids)
  No weapons. No realism. Reads as engineered defense footprint.

14 — CHECKPOINT (later)
TERRAIN: CHECKPOINT
Top face indicates controlled passage:
- one road-like band + a hard blocking bar crossing it
- small symmetric gate blocks
  Pure diagram. No signage. No text.
