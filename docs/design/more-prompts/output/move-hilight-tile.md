Generate a single isometric MOVE HIGHLIGHT tile for a tactical military board game.

REFERENCE ANGLE
- True isometric projection (30° / 30°)
- Diamond-shaped top face
- Left and right faces visible
- Exact same geometry as base flat ground tile

STYLE
Military command console.
Procedural movement overlay.
Technical, restrained, authoritative.

FORM
- Same slab geometry as base tile
- Uniform thickness
- Hard edges
- NO bevel
- NO shadow
- NO lighting

HIGHLIGHT LOGIC
- Highlight affects ONLY the top face
- Side faces remain neutral and unchanged
- Surface treatment only, not material change

COLOR
- Desaturated cold blue
- Low saturation
- Medium-light value
- Never neon, never bright
- Flat fill only

GRAPHIC RULES
- Optional subtle directional banding aligned with grid axes
- No arrows
- No glow
- No transparency
- No texture

SEMANTIC INTENT
Reads as: “reachable by movement”
Not a special tile, not terrain.

OUTPUT
- Single tile
- Transparent background
- Perfect alignment with base tile
