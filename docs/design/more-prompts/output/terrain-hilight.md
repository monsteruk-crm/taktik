Generate a single isometric TILE HIGHLIGHT overlay for a tactical military board game.

REFERENCE ANGLE
- True isometric projection (30° / 30°)
- Exact same geometry as a flat ground tile
- Diamond-shaped top face
- Left and right faces visible
- No perspective

STYLE
Military command console.
Procedural state overlay.
Technical, boring, authoritative.
Not decorative.

FORM
- Same slab geometry as base tile
- Same thickness and silhouette
- NO bevel
- NO shadow
- NO lighting

HIGHLIGHT LOGIC
- Highlight affects ONLY the top face
- Side faces remain neutral and unchanged
- Highlight is a flat surface treatment, not a material

COLOR
- Desaturated cyan / pale blue-green
- Low saturation
- Medium-light value (never neon)
- Clearly readable over green, but not dominant
- No gradients

GRAPHIC RULES
- Flat fill only OR flat fill + very subtle geometric banding
- Optional: thin inset border on top face only (hard-edged)
- No glow
- No transparency tricks
- No texture
- No noise

SEMANTIC INTENT
This must read as:
“this tile is selected / reachable”
NOT:
“this tile is special terrain”

OUTPUT
- Single tile only
- Transparent background
- Same scale and alignment as base tile
- Clean edges
