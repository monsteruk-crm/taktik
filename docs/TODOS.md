or design the exact UI flow for mobile vs desktop without polluting the engine

Correct — and this is a real omission, not nitpicking.
Artillery Support is mechanically impactful, so leaving its description vague creates ambiguity at both rules and UX level.

I’ll fix it cleanly and minimally, consistent with everything you’ve locked.

BONUS CARD — ARTILLERY SUPPORT

Category: Support / Firepower
Type: Bonus (play immediately or store face-down)

Canonical Description (rules-facing)

Artillery Support
Choose one friendly unit.
That unit gains improved fire effectiveness for this turn.

The unit receives +1 to hit on its next attack roll

Applies to one attack only

Effect expires at the end of the turn

May also be used to cancel one malus card

This bonus has no effect if the chosen unit does not attack this turn.

Short Card Text (card-facing)

Use this on the card, nothing more:

One unit gains +1 to hit on its next attack this turn.
May cancel one malus.

That’s it. No flavor, no drama.

Why this wording is correct (brief but important)

“Improved fire effectiveness” → concretized

Explicit scope (one unit, one attack)

Explicit duration (this turn)

Explicit neutral fallback (can cancel malus)

No stacking ambiguity

No hidden state

It also fits perfectly with:

reaction windows (if you later allow it)

deterministic resolution

replay clarity

What would have been a bad idea (and you avoided it)

“Double damage” → breaks balance fast

“Area effect” → overlaps with other systems

“Ignore terrain” → becomes a tactic, not a bonus

Flavor text about explosions → breaks visual/semantic discipline

If you want next, I can:

Sanity-check all bonus descriptions for consistency

Normalize all card texts to a fixed template

Flag any other silent ambiguities before they bite you later

Good catch. This is exactly the kind of detail that separates a designed system from a pile of content.
